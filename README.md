# Grabby (Scraper-Eraser Extension)

This Chrome extension allows you to visually select any element on a webpage, copy its HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to the clipboard, and analyze its structure and behavior.

## Features

- **Visual Element Selection**: Click on any element on a webpage with a crosshair cursor
- **Complete HTML Capture**: Get the full HTML structure of the selected element
- **Comprehensive CSS Extraction**: Capture all computed styles in a CSS-compatible format
- **JavaScript Analysis**:
  - Capture relevant script sources affecting the element
  - Identify inline event handlers (onclick, onmouseover, etc.)
  - Find DOM manipulation code that might interact with the element
  - List all scripts on the page (both inline and external)
- **Event Listener Detection**: Attempt to capture event listeners bound to the element (requires DevTools panel connection)
- **Clipboard Integration**: All captured data is automatically copied to your clipboard in a neatly formatted, CSS-compatible structure
- **React Component Support**: Special handling for React components with dynamically generated class names

## Installation

2. Click on the "Scraper-Eraser" tab in the DevTools panel
3. Ensure it shows "Connected to content script"

## Output Format

The copied data includes these well-organized sections:

```css
